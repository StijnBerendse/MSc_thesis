# MSc_thesis

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks and Python script used in the Master thesis "Towards explainable machine learning for prediction of disease progression".

The data required to run the scripts is not available here, as that is classified due to privacy reasons. A requirements.txt file is provided with the correct package versions to run the code on the machines used while performing the research.
